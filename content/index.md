## About My Journal

Hi! my name is Ricky and I am using this journal to blog my journey while Interning at Cascade STEAM, a local non-profit focusing on building community projects and mentorship.

I am working as a 'prototype' intern for their new startup project of building a self-sustaining IT internship model with community volunteers and interns.

My role is essentially a 'supervisor' for this internship model. I plan projects, make decisions and work with other students and community members to build our IT infrastructure and community tech support systems.

My mentor is [Garth Johnson](https://growlf.github.io/journal/) who is supporting me in my internship role so that I can have a low but not no-stakes experience as an intern with real responsibilities.
