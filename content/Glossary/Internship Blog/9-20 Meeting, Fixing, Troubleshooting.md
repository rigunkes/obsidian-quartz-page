Meeting with Cyrus from Dominion Cyber and Shawn. Discussing partnership and collaboration with Cascade STEAM and PiClub members in the Bellingham Community. It was a good opportunity to build a connection with a potential partner and a chance to talk about Cascade STEAM's community projects. It was a good networking experience and it went really well. We planned to meet in the future with more Cascade STEAM members.

Troubleshooted the music not working in the MakerSpace. Turns out it was a volume knob turned all the way down on the DAC.

Began working with Obsidian LiveSync so that we can our Cascade STEAM admin team fully connected to our documentation repository. As I was setting up the LiveSync, my obsidian application kept crashing right as I started the sync. We edited the sync settings to send less data in a single sync so that it does not overload the application.

Discussed the mentorship based internship model that Garth created. The core of this model is giving interns important roles with low stake but not no stakes. While having the safety net of a mentor to help them not fall.
