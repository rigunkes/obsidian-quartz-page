Created PiClub slideshow for Wednesday's meeting with Lili and Vivi.

ACTUALLY obsidian needs hidden files to enable plugins.

Troubleshooting Obsidian for a few hours.

Created a new database that is clean.
Imported the content.
Individually connected one by one.
Slowly added plugins and tested connectivity.
Had one error with the workstation.json file being overwritten.
It asks which one we would like to keep from an option of four.
The option labeled 'A' was the one we selected to keep.
This 'workstation.json' issue keeps persisting but does not cause any serious problems.

Garth told a few war stories.

After fixing the Obsidian database, we begin to work on Proxmox scripts.
At this point I am pretty burned out for the day.
We quickly go over some methods for creating our ESP but I will need to recap this next time.
