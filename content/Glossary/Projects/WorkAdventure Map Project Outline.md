Map will be created room by room.

Assign one room at a time per team to focus on.

Once each room has a completed fully decorated version, we will then splice all rooms together into the final map and build path spaces.

Rooms:
	Zones:
		Zone 1
			Lounge
			Meeting Area

		Zone 2
			Woodshop
			Laser
			Jewelry
			Studios
		Zone 3
			Fabric
			Electronics
			3D Print

For each room follow this process:
Map Building
	-Draw outline
	-Create Playable drawing
		-Simple object layer
		-Overlay drawing on top
		-Gauge Size and potential space needed for each room
	-Finalize outline and commit to one design
		-Can still be edited down the line.
		-Needs to have Makerspace general layout but size and shape can vary
	-Begin filling in the map with a floor
		-Choose/create floor sprite(s)
		-Start filling in over the outline with floor tiles
	-Then Set walls and boundaries for rooms
		-create wall boundaries to separate different areas
	-Add Furniture
		-Each room will have a open design for creative opportunity
		-Add tables
		-Add chairs
		-Add appliances
		-Add stairs
	-Add Decorations
		-Potted plants
		-Room-specific appliances
		-Statues 

After all Rooms in a Zone are completed, combine them into a Zone-Map
After All 4 Zone-Maps are completed, Combine them into the Makerspace-Map.
While building the makerspace map we will then follow the map-building task list one final time.
