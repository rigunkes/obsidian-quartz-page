Arrived at 4:20pm at the makerspace. I met Jenny here. 

I continued working on my Github Page, following a guide that Garth posted on his github page.

I created my page and troubleshooted a few things but I got it working and created a personal blog for everything I do at the makerspace.

I briefly explained to Jenny the process of creating a github page with obsidian and quartz.

I deleted the web pages that I made on raspberrypiclub.org

Garth explains workdventure and obsidian/markdown.

Garth talks about NotebookLM (AI tool for refining information)
