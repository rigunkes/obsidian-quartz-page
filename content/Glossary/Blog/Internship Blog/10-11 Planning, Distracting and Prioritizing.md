1:30pm-8PM
Arrived to a busy space, settled in and conversed with some makers.

Discussed with Quila and Mike about building a Digital Media Creation Workstation. I discussed with Jason and Grant(Board Members) on where to place this workstation. As well as allowing for a modular setup so that creators can bring a laptop or external hard drive to plug into the workstation.

Switched gears and started working on my priority list for Makerspace projects. Organizing a list of tasks and discussing with Garth on which tasks/projects are import/urgent and which order they need to be completed in. We created a general idea for the next week or two of work starting with cleaning up our hypervisor software and reorganizing our server nodes.

Then we can begin working on optimizing our containers for our prod environment. After our services and containers are optimized, we will start building network templates for the Digital Navigators to teach and maintain network best practices.

While working on all of this planning and prioritizing, there were a lot of distractions. At this point it was between 3 and 4pm on Saturday so there were lots of people around. Garth would get distracted in a conversation here and there, people would try to ask my help with something or Laith would throw in a totally random question that is irrelevant and takes way too much time to answer.

Sometimes these distractions can be frustrating but it also reinforces the idea that the makerspace is an active community environment where people support each other and work together in all types of projects.
