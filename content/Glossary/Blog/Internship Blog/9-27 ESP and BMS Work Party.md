Showed up to see a bunch of Makers moving things around to prepare for the remodel construction. I found my corner and started catching up on my Blog and writing down things that need to get done in preparation for the remodel.

These things include 
 - creating an ESP(Emergency Shutdown Procedure)
 - plan layout of server in the closet
 - layout of IT/Electronics area
 - create google account for QUE

Started populating the ESP discovery document with a list of devices that will need to be shutdown. Learn shutdown commands for docker stacks.
