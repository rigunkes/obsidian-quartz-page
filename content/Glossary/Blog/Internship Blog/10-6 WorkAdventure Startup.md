After some planning I worked with Garth and Lili to setup our first WorkAdventure world.

Today we wanted to test out the SaaS version of WorkAdventure. So Garth made an account for a Cascade STEAM meeting space.

Then he invited me into his world with a simple URL.

After joining with my account we explored the admin panel which WorkAdventure calls the 'back office'.

First we tried to give me admin permissions so that I could then access the back office. However, after giving me the 'admin' role, I was able to click the back office button but I would not be able to access it(providing an error screen when opened).

So I spent some time discovering the issue while Garth talked to some members.

I found out that there was a check box to allow the user 'Owner' permissions. After checking that box and saving the settings, I was able to access the back office. I gave the same permissions to Lili and we started exploring some of the tools.

We played with the map editor, allowing us to place furniture sprites around the map. 

We started learning about Zones, which are highlighted areas that admins can place around the map and use them to open links or activate certain applications and more.

We messed around with some more of the video call functionality. I found out that I was unable to mute Garth's microphone on my machine unless I open his video into an external tab.
