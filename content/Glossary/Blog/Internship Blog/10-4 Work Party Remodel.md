12pm-6pm

I show up and call Garth. He updates me on how the construction went over the last few days. Apparently the sockets were installed but they have no power...

So we have to wait another week for a transformer to arrive and be installed. So in the meanwhile Austin, Lili, Vivi, Laith, Ari Garth and I work to remodel the IT area ad BMS.

As Area Lead for the day I was tasked with giving people tasks and making decisions for where things should go, what furniture should be moved and what should be tossed.

After a few hours we ended up with a cleaner area, pending the move in for the datacenter.

Once the transformer gets installed we can get the datacenter moved into the closet and finish setting up the IT area.

I asked Kreig(BMS member that specializes in woodworking) to help us design an airflow solution for the closet door.

Kreig had the idea of drilling a bunch of holes in the bottom of the door to provide optimal airflow from the front of the closet.

I had Vivi draw some plans and Kreig helped us with a final design.

Now we wait for him to drill the holes in the door before we can set it up again.
