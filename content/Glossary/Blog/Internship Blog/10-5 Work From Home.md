Cascade STEAM Service core

We started discussing the mentor-based internship model and how we want that to look in the future. After going over the core methods for this model we move on to some questions I had about the upcoming PiClub demo regarding github-obsidian journals.

We went through our slideshow and Garth helped point out some things that we would need to change or add.

After working through the slideshow we took a break and moved onto some work on our hypervisor 'proxmox' server at BMS. We talked about the plans for our server in the coming weeks while cleaning out old VM's and containers that are unused or unneeded. 

The plan is to leave the datacenter at BMS to be a dev environment where we can sandbox new tools and infrastructure. With a prod server at an offsite location running on the Cascade STEAM datacenter in NorthWest Technology.

We will have to stage these servers before we install them at NWT. This will require some more planning on my part while I work with Garth to find our best solution.
