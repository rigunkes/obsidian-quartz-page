I showed up today around 3:30pm and met Jenny. Garth was distracted talking to someone for awhile. I spent 30 minutes adding a personal blog page to raspberrypiclub.org and updated some plugins. The website shutdown while I was updating and I thought that there was a DNS issue so I spent ten minutes messing around in the DNS zone settings but it did not fix(or break) the issue. I simply just had to wait for the updates to finish. The website is up and running now.

I worked with Garth learning about Obsidian/Github collaboration. He showed me how to setup a Github repository, create a github page and link it to my obsidian vault. 

Then we worked on fixing some missing DNS entries for the BMS network.

we added the raspberrypiclub.org zone so that we can resolve to the wiki.
We also fixed some IP overlap and fixed the routing for proxmox.bellinghammakerspace.org
